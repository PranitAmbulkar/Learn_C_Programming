C language was invented during UNIX operating system by Dennis Ritchie.
C language was designed while parting UNIX operating sysytem on PDP11.
Assembly languages are converted into machine language by using a special program called as assembler. 
Compiler and interpreter converts high level languages in order to executes the codes.
For every instructions of the high level language code is translated into one or more instructions of the machine level code.
C,C++,java are high level languages.
Compiler is predefined program which convert the high level language into the binary language.
Programmer provides interface by which end user can be easily interact the machines.

Identifiers

Identifiers are simply the names that are used to identify variables,functions,macros,etc.
First character of identifier must be alphabet or underscore and no commas,blanks or special symbols.
eg.m_hra,po_1235,create_node,basicsal,etc.

Keywords 
Keywords are the words treated specially by the compiler with their standard meaning.
The keywords cannot be used as variable names.
There are 32 keywords in C Language.
enum,void,const,volatile,signed,in,float,char,do,while,for,if,else,break,switch,case,default,etc.
Few compilers also have reserved words like near,fear,huge.

Data Types

C Program involves some computations.
C Language is a typed language.
char,int,float,double are primary data types. 
structure,union,enum are user defined data types.

Data type 


                -----> int                 ----> 2 or 4 bytes
                -----> short int           ----> 2 bytes
int             -----> signed short int    ----> 2 bytes
                -----> long int            ----> 4 bytes
				-----> signed long int     ----> 4 bytes
				-----> unsigned long int   ----> 4 bytes
				

char            -----> signed char         ----> 1 byte       
                -----> unsigned char       ----> 1 byte


float           -----> float               ----> 4 bytes

double          -----> double              ----> 8 bytes
                -----> long double 	       ----> 10 bytes 
				
Size of simple integer data type varies from compiler to compiler.
On 16-bit compiler its size is 2bytes and it behaves like short e.g. Turbo C
On 32-bit compiler its size is 4 bytes and its behave like long e.g.GCC
